# OGL
OpenGL minimalistic library for game development
This library provides classes to support OpenGL context creation, API initialization, and input processing. The intention of this library is to avoid use of OpenGL extensions such as freeglut/glew/etc. Unfortunately, I was too lazy to implement PNG image processing so that is not included. This library was developed to support the GhostSchool project (rip-off of Ms. Pacman)
